**7.** Make your changes to the source code.

**8.** Stage your changes:

⚠️ **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file

⚠️ **Make sure** not to run the commands `git add .` or `git add *`

> Instead, stage your changes for each file/folder
>
> By using public path it means it will add all files and folders under that folder, it is better to be specific

```bash
git add public
```

_or_

```bash
git add "<files_you_have_changed>"
```

**9.** Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
